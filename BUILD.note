Export requirement:
	$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

Run on Windows:
# os.add_dll_directory(r'C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC')
Need to enable this on __init__.py to locate VLC

Build and Install:
- When you want to deploy your application elsewhere, you build a distribution file. The current standard for Python distribution is the wheel format, with the .whl extension. Make sure the wheel library is installed first:
	$ pip install wheel
- Make setup.py
- Run setup.py
	$ python setup.py bdist_wheel
- Setup new virtualenv:
	+ Create an environment
		. Create a project folder and a venv folder within:
			$ py -3 -m venv venv # (windows)
			$ python3 -m venv venv # (linux)
		. Activate the environment
			venv\Scripts\activate # (window) 
			$ . venv/bin/activate # (linux)
	+ Install Flask, within the activated environment
		$ pip install Flask
- Copy *.whl file to production pc
- Install by:
	$ pip install flaskr-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
- export FLASK_APP:
	$env:FLASK_APP="ytplayer_pkg"
	
To deploy Python application:
- Install python
- Use Waitress, first install it in the virtual environment:
	$ pip install waitress

- You need to tell Waitress about your application, but it doesn’t use FLASK_APP like flask run does. You need to tell it to import and call the application factory to get an application object.
	$ waitress-serve --call 'ytplayer_pkg:create_app'
